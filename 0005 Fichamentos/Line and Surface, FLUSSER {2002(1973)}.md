# Line and Surface 

- This afﬁrms thatlines are discourses ofpoints,and that each point is a symbol ofsome-thing out there in the world (a “concept”). (Page 60) 
-  The problem is to ﬁnd out what adequation there is be-tween the surfaces and the world on the one hand,and between the sur-face and the lines on the other.It is no longer just a question ofthe ade-quation ofthought to thing,but ofthought expressed in surfaces on theone hand,and thought expressed in lines on the other. (Page 61) 
- Another difﬁculty has to do with the fact that although thoughtthat is expressed in surfaces now predominates in the world,this kind ofthought is not quite so much aware ofits own structure as is thought ex-pressed in lines. (Page 61) 


## Adequation of “Surface Thought” to “Line Thought” 
- The differ-ence seems to be that in reading lines we follow a structure imposedupon us,whereas in reading pictures we move rather freely within astructure that has been proposed to us. (Page 61) 
- Thisgives us the following difference between reading written lines and pic-tures:we must follow the written text ifwe want to get at its message,butin pictures we may get the message ﬁrst,and then try to decompose it. (Page 62) 
- And this points to the difference between the one-dimensional line andthe two-dimensional surface:the one aims at getting somewhere;theother is there already,but may reveal how it got there.This difference isone oftemporality,and involves the present,the past,and the future. (Page 62) 
- If,then,we call the time involved in reading written lines “historicaltime,”we ought to call the time involved in reading pictures by a differentname,because “history”has the sense ofgoing somewhere,whereas,while reading pictures,we need go nowhere.The proofofthis is simple:it takes many more minutes to describe what one has seen in a picturethan it does to see it. (Page 62) 
- It may be said that ﬁlms are read as ifthey were a series ofpictures.But these pictures are not identical with the pictures ofwhich the ﬁlm isphysically composed,with the photographs that compose its ribbon.They are more like moving pictures ofscenes in a play,and this is the rea-son why the reading ofﬁlms is often compared to the reading ofstageddrama,rather than to the reading ofpictures.But this is an error,becausethe stage has three dimensions and we can walk into it,while the screen isa two-dimensional projection and we can never penetrate it.The theaterrepresents the world ofthings through things,and the ﬁlm represents theworld ofthings through projections ofthings;the reading ofﬁlms goes onin a plane,like the reading ofpictures (although it is a reading of“talkingpictures,”a problem we will return to later). (Page 63) 
- This discloses a centraldifference:the reading ofﬁlms goes on in the same “historical time”inwhich the reading ofwritten lines occurs,but the “historical time”itselfoccurs,within the reading ofﬁlms,on a new and different level. (Page 63) 
- In reading written lines,we are following“historically”given points (concepts).In reading ﬁlms,we are following“historically”given surfaces (images). (Page 63) 
- But this situation willchange in the very near future.It is even now technically possible to pro-ject ﬁlms and TV programs that allow the reader to control and manipu-late the sequence ofthe pictures,and to superimpose other pictures uponthem.Videoscopes and multimedia shows point clearly to this possibility.In consequence,the “history”ofa ﬁlm will be something that is partlydevised or manipulated by the reader.It will even become partially re-versible. (Page 64) 
- Now,these developments imply a radically new meaning oftheterm historical freedom.For those who think in written lines,the termmeans the possibility ofacting upon history from withinhistory.Forthose who think in ﬁlms,however,it will mean the possibility ofactingupon history from without.This is so because those who think in writtenlines stand within history,and those who think in ﬁlms look at it fromwithout. (Page 64) 
- In a sense,it may be said that these new channelsincorporate the temporality ofthe written line into the picture,by liftingthe linear historical time ofwritten lines onto the level ofthe surface. (Page 65) 


## Adequation of “Surface Thought” to “Things” 
- Photograph and explanation are mediations between me and the stone;they put themselves between the stone and myself,and they introduceme to it.But I can also walk directly toward the stone and stumble over it. (Page 65) 
- Western epistemology is based on the Carte-sian premise that to think means to follow the written line,and it doesnot give the photograph its due as a way ofthinking.Let us therefore tryto forget that,according to our school’s tradition,to adequate thought tothing means to adequate concept to extension (point to body).Thewhole problem oftruth and falsehood,ofﬁction and reality,must nowbe reformulated in the light ofthe mass media ifwe are to avoid the bar-renness ofacademicism. (Page 65) 
- We live in an expanding uni-verse:the media offer us more and more things ofwhich we can have noimmediate experience,and take away,one by one,the things with whichwe can communicate directly. (Page 66) 
- Written lines relate (Page 66) 
- their symbols to their meanings point by point (they “conceive”the factsthey mean),while surfaces relate their symbols to their meanings by two-dimensional contexts (they “imagine”the facts they mean—ifthey trulymean facts and are not empty symbols).Thus,our situation provides uswith two sorts ofﬁction:the conceptual and the imaginal;their relationto fact depends on the structure ofthe medium. (Page 67) 
- On the other hand,ifwe try to read anewspaper,we need not assume a point ofview imposed on us.Ifweknow what the symbol “a”means,it does not matter how we look at it—italways means itself.But we cannot read the newspaper unless we havelearned the meaning ofits symbols.This reveals the difference betweenthe structure ofconceptual and imaginal codes and their respective meansofdecodiﬁcation. (Page 67) 
- Therefore,imaginal ﬁction relates to fact ina subjective and unconscious way,while conceptual ﬁction relates to factin an objective and conscious way. (Page 67) 
- Therefore,the meaning ofconceptual ﬁction is much narrower than the meaning ofimaginal ﬁc-tion,although it is far more clear and distinct.Facts are represented morefullyby imaginal thought,more clearlyby conceptual thought. (Page 67) 
- We can all participate inboth types ofmedia,but participation in the second type requires thatwe ﬁrst learn how to use its techniques.This explains the division ofourcivilization into a mass culture (those who participate almost exclusivelyin surface ﬁction) and an elite culture (those who participate almost ex-clusively in linear ﬁction). (Page 68) 
- Therefore,the messages oflinear ﬁction can no longer be made satisfac-torily adequate to the immediate experience we still have ofthe world.For the mass culture,the problem is that the more technically perfect theimages become,the richer they become and the more completely theysubstitute themselves for the facts they may have originally represented. (Page 68) 
- They no longer need tobe made adequate to the immediate experience ofthe world;that experi-ence is thus abandoned. (Page 68) 
- We canno longer pass from conceptual thought to fact for lack ofadequation,and we can no longer pass from imaginal thought to fact for lack ofacriterion that enables us to distinguish between fact and image (Page 68) 
- Imaginal thought will be a translation from concept into image,and con-ceptual thought a translation from image to concept.In such a feedbacksituation,an adequate model can ﬁnally be elaborated.First there will bean image ofsomething,then there will be an explanation ofthat image,and then there will be an image ofthat explanation.This will result in amodel ofsomething (this something having been,originally,a concept). (Page 69) 
- And this model may ﬁt a stone (or some other fact,or nothing).Thus afact,or the absence ofa fact,will have been disclosed.There would oncemore exist a criterion ofdistinction between fact and ﬁction (ﬁt andunﬁt models),and a sense ofreality would have been recovered. (Page 69) 
- Fundamentally,this means that imaginal thought is becoming capableofthinking about concepts.It can transform a concept into its “object,”and can therefore become a metathought ofconceptual thinking.So far,concepts have been thinkable only in terms ofother concepts,by reﬂec-tion.Reﬂective thought was the metathought ofconceptual thinking,and was itselfconceptual.Now,imaginal thought can begin thinkingabout concepts in the form ofsurface models. (Page 69) 


## Toward a Posthistorical Future 
- Our present imaginal media (ﬁlms,etc.) are obviouslydevelopments from conceptual thought;for one thing,they result fromscience and technology,which are conceptual.And,in addition,they aredevelopments from conceptual thought in that they advance along lineardiscursive lines,which are conceptual. (Page 70) 
- the present civilization doesnot look like the result ofa linear development from image to concept,but rather like the result ofa sort ofspiral movement from image throughconcept to image (Page 70) 
- Through thinking in concepts,he became not only subject toan objectiﬁed world offacts,but also subject to an objectiﬁed world ofimages.Now,however,by again having recourse to his imaginal capacity,he is beginning to learn how to handle his conceptual world.Throughimagination,he is now beginning to objectify his concepts and thus tofree himselffrom them.In the ﬁrst position,he stands in the midst ofstatic images (in myth);in the second position,he stands in the midst oflinear progressive concepts (in history);in the third position he stands inthe midst ofimages that order concepts (in “structures”).But this thirdposition implies a being-in-the-world so radically new that its manifoldimpacts are difﬁcult to grasp. (Page 71) 
- The spectator is still determinedby history (by the video theater) and he still acts within history (by ap-pearing on the screen himself).But he is beyond history in the sense thathe composes a historical process,and in the sense that he may assumeany role he desires in the historical process.This may be stated even moreforcefully:although he acts in history and is determined by history,he isno longer interested in history as such,but in the possibility ofcombin-ing various histories.This means that history for him is not a drama (as itis for the historical position);it is a game. (Page 72) 
- All that has been said concerning the third po-sition has been composed into written lines,and is therefore a product ofconceptual thinking.But ifthe argument is even partly correct,the thirdposition cannot be conceptualized;it must be imagined with the kind ofimagination that is now being formed. (Page 72) 
- Let us,then,recapitulate our argument,in order to try to suggest whatform the new civilization might take.We have two alternatives before us.First,there is the possibility that imaginal thinking will not succeed inincorporating conceptual thinking.This could lead to a generalized de-politicization,deactivation,and alienation ofhumankind,to the victoryofthe consumer society,and to the totalitarianism ofthe mass media.Such a development would look very much like the present mass culture,but in more exaggerated or gross form.The culture ofthe elite would dis-appear for good,thus bringing history to an end in any meaningful senseofthat term.The second possibility is that imaginal thinking will succeedin incorporating conceptual thinking.This would lead to new types ofcommunication in which man consciously assumes the structural posi-tion.Science would then be no longer merely discursive and conceptual,but would have recourse to imaginal models.Art would no longer workat things (“oeuvres”),but would propose models.Politics would nolonger ﬁght for the realizations ofvalues,but would elaborate manipula-ble hierarchies ofmodels ofbehavior.All this would mean,in short,thata new sense ofreality would articulate itself,within the existential climateofa new religiosity.
